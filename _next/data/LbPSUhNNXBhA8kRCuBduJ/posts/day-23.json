I am talking about HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).</p>\n<h3>So What is HTTP?</h3>\n<p>HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol for transferring of hypermedia like HTML documents which then we can access through a web-browser. HTTP is the foundation of the Web. HTTP was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN.</p>\n<h3>How does HTTP works?</h3>\n<p>HTTP is a client server-protocol. It works the way that a recipient initiates an HTTP request to a server through a web-browser which opens the connection between the client and the server and HTTP waits for the response and after receiving the response the connection is closed or resued for more reqeusts.\r\nHTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol is a communication protocol in which the data between the requests made from the client to server is not stored.</p>\n<h3>HTTP Flow</h3>\n<p>Following are the steps HTTP takes to complete a request.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opens a TCP connection to send a request and receive a response.</li>\n<li>Sends an HTTP message which looks something like</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-http\">GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: zainsci.github.io/blog\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Reads the response sent by the server which looks like</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-http\">HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Sat, 23 Jan 2021 16:59:32 GMT\r\nServer: GitHub.com\r\nLast-Modified: Fri, 22 Jan 2021 17:07:27 GMT\r\nETag: W/\"600b064f-97ef\"\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nContent-Length: 9675\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\r\n&#x3C;html>\r\n    &#x3C;9675 bytes/>\r\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Close the connection or resue it for more requests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 200 in front of the HTTP/1.1 in the response above is a response code which means that everything went well.</p>\n<h3>HTTP Response Status Codes</h3>\n<p>HTTP Response Status Codes are divided into five groups and each code is a three digit code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1xx</strong> - Informational</li>\n<li><strong>2xx</strong> - Successful</li>\n<li><strong>3xx</strong> - Redirection</li>\n<li><strong>4xx</strong> - Client Error</li>\n<li><strong>5xx</strong> - Server Error</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is alot more to the HTTP that is not discussed here but that is all I can write for now.
