{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Day 96 - Coding Interview Question [FizzBuzz]","date":"2021-04-06","slug":"day-96","content":"<p>FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. What happens is that players take turns to count numbers incrementally with replacing every number divisible by 3 with the word \"Fizz\" and the number divisible by 5 with the word \"Buzz\". Besides being a game for children it is also a common coding interview question to test how much does one understands the programming concepts. I will be implementing FizzBuzz in python in this post.</p>\n<p>I will also be trying to make it as small as possible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">for i in range(100):\r\n    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\r\n        print(\"FizzBuzz\")\r\n    elif i % 3 == 0:\r\n        print(\"Fizz\")\r\n    elif i % 5 == 0:\r\n        print(\"Buzz\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(i)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here it first checks for whether the number i is divisible by both 3 and 5 and if it does it prints both words \"FizzBuzz\" else it will print \"Fizz\" if the number is divisible by 3 and \"Buzz\" if the word is divisible by 5.</p>\n<p>Making it even shorter by using ternary operators in python.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">for i in range(100):\r\n    print(\"FizzBuzz\") if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0 else \\\r\n    print(\"Fizz\") if i % 3 == 0 else \\\r\n    print(\"Buzz\") if i % 5 == 0 else print(i)\r\n\r\n    # Forward Slashes here let us brake\r\n    # a big python line into smaller lines\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now converting this to functions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">def fizz_buzz(num_1, num_2, lim):\r\n    for i in range(lim):\r\n        print(\"FizzBuzz\") if i % num_1 == 0 and i % num_2 == 0 else \\\r\n        print(\"Fizz\") if i % num_1 == 0 else \\\r\n        print(\"Buzz\") if i % num_2 == 0 else print(i)\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    fizz_buzz(3,5,100)\r\n    return\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Following is the same approach to solve FizzBuzz in Javascript.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">for (let i = 1; i &#x3C;= 100; i++) {\r\n  i % 3 === 0 &#x26;&#x26; i % 5 === 0\r\n    ? console.log(\"FizzBuzz\")\r\n    : i % 3 === 0\r\n    ? console.log(\"Fizz\")\r\n    : i % 5 === 0\r\n    ? console.log(\"Buzz\")\r\n    : console.log(i);\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n","tags":["Python","JavaScript","Interview-Questions"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
