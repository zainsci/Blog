Now we will be looking on some key differences between paging and segmentation.</p>\n<p>So what are some of the key differences of paging and sengmentation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The segments vary in size while the pages do not vary in size.</li>\n<li>The segments are specified by the programmer to the compiler or assembler while the compiler or memory management system itself divides the program into pages.</li>\n<li>There is no internal fragmentation in segmentation but there is internal fragmentation in paging within frames.</li>\n<li>Segmentation suffers from external fragmentations but there is no external fragmentation in paging.</li>\n<li>The OS must maintain a segment table for each process to show the load address and length of segment also must maintain a page table to show how much frames are being used by each page.</li>\n<li>The OS must maintain a list of free holes in the memory and a free list of frames.</li>\n<li>The processor uses segment number and offset to calculate absolute address and it also uses page number to calculate absolute address.</li>\n</ol>\n","tags":["Operating-Systems"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
