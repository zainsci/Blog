{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Day 135 - Eid ul Fitr Day 03","date":"2021-05-15","slug":"day-135","content":"<p>This is the third day of Eid and holidays will be over today and I was thinking of learning some new tech starting from tomorrow. I wanted to learn something that was not a new thing in itself like with Rust and OS but something that will help me with something that I already know about.</p>\n<p>So I decided to learn about Redux and after that I little bit about React Native. Redux is a library that helps you manage state in React apps and up until now I haven't built any react app where I would have used redux but there was once a social media like app that I was building that had to have a user authentication. And for that someone on the internet suggested that I should learn redux for this.</p>\n<p>So here comes the redux. Starting from tomorrow I will start learning redux which I think will be easy as I already know react and context and stuff. And even if it is not easy it will be good exercise.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
