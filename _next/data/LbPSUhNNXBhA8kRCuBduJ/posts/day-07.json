When I started this blog from gatsby-starter-blog there were already other starter kits on the Gatsby website but I choose this because first it will be easy to learn and maintain it if I build most of it myself and second there will be too much functionality and plugins in the other kits that I Know I will not be needing.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>💻 Programming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>PWA - Progressive Web Apps are Installable WebApps that work on all Platforms (Android, iOS, PC) are built with basic web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
