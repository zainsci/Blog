But as I am writing this after I merged them both that is not what happend.</p>\n<p>All the new files I added to the <code>contents/blog/</code> dir were automatically appeared in the public folder.</p>\n<p>This is day 131 but I will not be merging the <code>next</code> into the master branch today because I still don't know if it the right time to do so and also maybe it will make things more difficult to handle so lets see what happens next.</p>\n","tags":["GatsbyJS","NextJS","JavaScript"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
