The reason I am writing this instead of something about OS is because of not getting enough time to write these anymore. So from now on I will be doing some little posts like these when I didn't learnt anything about the Subject that I will be learning or didn't got the time to write about it. So here we go.</p>\n<p>So i was learning about Material-UI for one of my project and saw in the import statements that you do for MUI's component is that there is the symbol <code>@</code> before every import like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import Typography from \"@material-ui/core/Typography\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to search for it and found out that you can use a configuration in the JS projects which lets you use @ instead of thoese long import statement which include slashes and dots in them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Before\r\nimport theme from \"../../styles/theme\";\r\n// After\r\nimport theme from \"@styles/theme\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can do this by creating a file called <code>jsconfig.json</code> in the root directory of our projects and adding a key-value pair like this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\r\n  \"paths\": {\r\n    \"@styles\": [\"styles/*\"],\r\n    \"@components\": [\"components/*\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now whenever we have to import some file from styles directory we only just need to use <code>@styles</code> to do that insted of using dots and slashes.</p>\n","tags":["JavaScript"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
