{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Day 132 - What's Next For This Blog","date":"2021-05-12","slug":"day-132","content":"<p>This post will be kind of a roadmap for this blog of mine and what I think I will make big improvements in the Blogs design and in functionality.Today there is not much for me to write today as I was only doing little chores in my little projects as well on this blog and there is much for me to do on the styling side of the blog as well as on designing the Contact and About page for this website.</p>\n<p>So here's the deal, First of all I will be styling this blog as simple and good looking as possible. This new desing is kind of like the old design but will little diffrences like NavBar, Footer, and Dark Theme etc. It also includes other pages about the author like contact and about and portfolio and stuff.</p>\n<p>After that I have to desing and fill in the Contact and About page with enough info that if someone wants to contact me, they could do so with minimal ease.</p>\n<p>After that I am thinking of adding pagination to the site so that not all the posts appear on the same page as they\r\nare right now. But before that I will be adding a Tags related posts page where all the posts with simillar tag will appear.</p>\n<p>After some time I will try to have a proper backend and a data base for this blog as well my site. Currently both of my sites blog and personal are hosted on GitHub Pages but there is not much you can do with GitHub pages alone so in future I will have a proper backed for this and personal website.</p>\n<p>And last but not least I will try to create some side projects of my own like other developers to obviously make some money for me and for these projects as well. A good example of these side project can be like a website that can help other developers simillar to how <a href=\"https://coolors.co\">Coolors.co</a> always helps with selecting color palettes.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
