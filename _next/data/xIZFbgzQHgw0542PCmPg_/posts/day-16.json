As always first I searched for explanation on XSS on Youtube and found some amazing videos and then I searched for XSS on some other websites like Wikipedia and MDN.</p>\n<p>After learning about the XSS I thought about what could go wrong with my site in terms of XSS and here are my conclusions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As explained in the Article on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/security-in-gatsby/\">Gatsby.js Offical Documentation on Security in GatsbyJS</a>, the only way someone can inject code in my site is through some input that stores the input data in the Backend Database and then renders it on the site but for now I don't have any input or form on the site where someone could input some malicious code.</li>\n<li>And I also don't have any Backend Database as I am hosting this static-site on Github.com.</li>\n<li>And for security measures I will use either <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html\">sanitize-html</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify\">DOMPurify</a> to sanitize HTML on the site.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>💻 Programming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>XSS - Cross-Site Scripting - Following are some resources that I researched for this blog post and also for the website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-site scripting - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>XSS on Google Search - Sanitizing HTML in The Client? - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lG7U3fuNw3A\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did Masato find the Google Search XSS? - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gVrdE6g_fa8\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-Site Scripting Explained with Examples and How to Prevent XSS with Content Security Policy - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pD6C1-zSxIM\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>7 Security Risks and Hacking Stories for Web Developers - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4YOpILi9Oxs\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) - <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security in Gatsby - <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/security-in-gatsby/\">Link</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🗾 Langauge[<span lang=\"ja\">日本語</span>]</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>弱点</strong> (じゃくてん)</span> Weak Point. <span lang=\"ja\">弱</span>: Weak, <span lang=\"ja\">点</span>: Point.0</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>電池</strong> (でんち)</span> Battery. <span lang=\"ja\">電</span>: Electricity, <span lang=\"ja\">池</span>: Pond.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>対立</strong> (たいりつ)</span> Confrontation. <span lang=\"ja\">対</span>: Versus, <span lang=\"ja\">立</span>: Stand.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>究明</strong> (きゅうめい)</span> Investigation. <span lang=\"ja\">究</span>: Research, <span lang=\"ja\">明</span>: Bright.</li>\n</ul>\n","tags":["Security","Web-Attacks","XSS"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
