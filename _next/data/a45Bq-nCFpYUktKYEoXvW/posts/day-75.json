Threads are of mainly two levels, user threads and kernel threads.</p>\n<p>User threads are supported above the kernel and are managed without the help from the kernel and kernel threads are directly supported by the Operating System. A relationship must exist between user threads and kernel threads. There are maily three types of realtions used in user-kernel threading model. These are following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many-to-One Model</li>\n<li>One-to-One Model</li>\n<li>Many-to-Many Model</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Many-to-One Model</h3>\n<p>Many-to-One model maps many user-level threads to a single kernel-level threads. It is done in the user space by the thread library. In Many-to-One model if a thread makes a system blocking call it will block entire process. Only one thread can access the kernel at a time which makes it unable for multi threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/day-75/many-to-one.jpg\" alt=\"Many To One Multi-threading Model\"></p>\n<h3>One-to-One Model</h3>\n<p>One-to-One model maps each user thread to a single kernel thread. This way other threads can keep runnig while one thread is asking for a blocking system call. It also allows multiple threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</p>\n<p>The drawback to this model is that running one user thread requires one kernel thread to run with it which can cause a burden on the system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"one-to-one.jpg\" alt=\"One To One Multi-threading Model\"></p>\n<h3>Many-to-Many Model</h3>\n<p>Many-to-Many model maps many user-level threads to less or equal number of kernle threads.The number of threads may be specific to an application or to a particular machine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"many-to-many.jpg\" alt=\"Many To Many Multi-threading Model\"></p>\n","tags":["Operating-Systems"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
