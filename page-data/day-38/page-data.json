This post will explain in details what are groups and also how we can change file permissions with <code class=\"language-text\">chmod</code> commdand.</p>\n<h2>What are Groups?</h2>\n<p>Groups in Linux is a way to organize users that have the same permissions on the filesystem. It is a collection of users that have the same permissions and is for security measures.</p>\n<p>The superuser or root user is part of the <code class=\"language-text\">root</code> group and has all the access on the operating system and admin privillages and if a new user is created and added in the root group that user will also have the same permissions as the root user. It can read, write or modify any file it want and can navigate to any directory. If a user from a group create a new file any other user of the same group can access that file and modify or write to it.</p>\n<p>List of all the groups and its member users are stored in the <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/group</code> file and you can see all the detials by running cat command with <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/group</code> as the first argument. Now on to creating groups and assigning users to it.</p>\n<h3>How to create groups?</h3>\n<p>To create a new group <code class=\"language-text\">addgroup</code> command id used.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ addgroup linux-group</code></pre></div>\n<h3>To add users to the group</h3>\n<p>To add users to the newly created groups simply use the <code class=\"language-text\">usermod</code> command with following commands.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ <span class=\"token function\">usermod</span> -a -G new-group new-user</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here <code class=\"language-text\">usermod</code> is the command name <code class=\"language-text\">-a</code> is the flag for append to append a user to group <code class=\"language-text\">new-group</code> with <code class=\"language-text\">-G</code> as the flag and lastly the name of the user <code class=\"language-text\">new-user</code> or whatever the name of the user is.</p>\n<h3>To remove the user from the group</h3>\n<p>To remove the user from the group run the follwoing command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ gpasswd -d new-user new-group\nRemoving user new-user from group new-group</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gpasswd -d</code> means delete the user from the group.</p>\n<h3>Permissions to the Group</h3>\n<p>The permissions to the groups are assigned and managed in the <code class=\"language-text\">visudo</code> file that the root user has access to. and to add permissions for the group and user to have access to certin commands we open the visudo file by just the filename in the command and edit the permissions.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ visudo\n\n--- visudo <span class=\"token function\">file</span> starts ---\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># User privilege specification</span>\nroot    <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ALL</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ALL:ALL<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> ALL\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Members of the admin group may gain root privileges</span>\n%admin <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ALL</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ALL<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> ALL\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Allow members of group sudo to execute any command</span>\n%sudo   <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ALL</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ALL:ALL<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> ALL\n%new-group <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">ALL</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>/usr/bin/ls\n<span class=\"token comment\"># You type % sign and the name of the group</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># following ALL for all users and</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># the name of the commands the group</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># can have access to separated with</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># commas and must include the path to command</span>\n\n--- visudo <span class=\"token function\">file</span> ends ---</code></pre></div>\n<h2>File Permissiosn</h2>\n<p>Now I will navigate to the <code class=\"language-text\">/tmp</code> directory and run the following command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/tmp$ <span class=\"token function\">ls</span> -l\ntotal <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n-rw-r--r-- <span class=\"token number\">1</span> root root    <span class=\"token number\">0</span> Feb  <span class=\"token number\">7</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>:04 file.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x <span class=\"token number\">5</span> root root <span class=\"token number\">4096</span> Jan <span class=\"token number\">19</span> 00:10 tutorial</code></pre></div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ls</code> command with list flag <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> for list view with details about the files.
