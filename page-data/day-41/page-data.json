Type commands in this editor press <code class=\"language-text\">Ctrl+X</code> enter <code class=\"language-text\">Y</code> and hit enter button twice and it will run all the commands in the file one by one.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ Ctrl+x+e\nGNU <span class=\"token function\">nano</span> <span class=\"token number\">2.9</span>            /tmp/bash-fc.zcF\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command One\"</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Two\"</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Three\"</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Four\"</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># These are all the commands that</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># will run after I close the Editor</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># by pressing Ctrl+X and type Y and hit</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Enter or Return button twice</span>\n\nroot@User:~$\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command One\"</span>\nHello From Command One\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Two\"</span>\nHello From Command Two\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Three\"</span>\nHello From Command Three\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello From Command Four\"</span>\nHello From Command Four\nroot@User:~$</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Editing The Last Command</h2>\n<p>This command is simillar to the last commadn as it will aslo open an editor to write the command but this is used if you wrote a lenghty command and something in it was wrong and you have to change something in it.</p>\n<p>To use it type <code class=\"language-text\">fc</code> after the the command you want to edit and it will open an editor which will let you chage it the way you want.</p>\n<h2>Navigating A File</h2>\n<p>Seeing the contents of a file to read it can be done with cat command but it will print out all the lines in the file which can be hard to navigate in the terminal so for this most the devs use <code class=\"language-text\">less</code> command. <code class=\"language-text\">less</code> command with the file name in front of it will open a file navigator which will help you read the file while scrolling up and down with the arrow keys.</p>\n<h2>Checking History Of Used Commands</h2>\n<p>To check what commands have been used in the current session of the terminal just type <code class=\"language-text\">history</code> command and it will print out the previous commands from the session.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"One\"</span>\nOne\nroot@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> file.txt\nroot@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">history</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"One\"</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">touch</span> file.txt</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Avoid Getting A Command In History</h2>\n<p>To avoid getting a command getting recorded in the terminal session history, Add a single space before typing the command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"One\"</span>\nOne\nroot@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> file.txt\nroot@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">history</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"One\"</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">touch</span> file.txt\nroot@User:~$  <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hidden\"</span>\nHidden\nroot@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">history</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"One\"</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">touch</span> file.txt</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Making Multiple Directories</h2>\n<p>To make multiple directories with a single command just type the already know <code class=\"language-text\">mkdir</code> command with number of folders from starting number to finish number separated by two dots inside curly braces just like the following and it will create that many folders.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/tmp/temp$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span><span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\nroot@User:/tmp/temp$ <span class=\"token function\">ls</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">1</span>   <span class=\"token number\">10</span>  <span class=\"token number\">2</span>   <span class=\"token number\">3</span>   <span class=\"token number\">4</span>   <span class=\"token number\">5</span>   <span class=\"token number\">6</span>   <span class=\"token number\">7</span>   <span class=\"token number\">8</span>   <span class=\"token number\">9</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Shutting Down System</h2>\n<p>This one may not seem useful at first because you can just click a button and it will shutdown your system but when you are getting used to a keyboard, going from keyboard to the mouse to click seems more difficult than just typing shutdown.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 41 - Some More Useful Commands","date":"February 10, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-40/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 40 -
