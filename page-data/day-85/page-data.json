Both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. Today we will be learning about another way of solving the critical section problem and that is called <strong>Semaphores</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Semaphores</h2>\n<p>Semaphores is another way of preventing critical section problem to occur. It can be a variable or an abstract data type that is used to control access to common resources by the multiple processes. A semaphore is an integer variable that is used by oprocesses to send signal to other processes. It can only be accessed by the following two operations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P (Wait or Down)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>V (Signal or Up)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The definations of both these functions are below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"py\"><pre class=\"language-py\"><code class=\"language-py\"><span class=\"token keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"token function\">Wait</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>S<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>S <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># Do Something</span>\n  S <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> S <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"token function\">Signal</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>S<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  S <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> S <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Any change to both these operations must be executed individually and while some process is executing these operations no other process is allowed to make any chage during the execution.</p>\n<p>Semaphores are used to solve the critical section problem for <strong>n</strong> number of processes. The processes use a shared semaphore of <strong>mutex</strong> initialized to 1. This implementation is follows.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"py\"><pre class=\"language-py\"><code class=\"language-py\"><span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  Wait<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># Critical Section</span>\n  Signal<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>mutex<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\"># Remainder Section</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Here a <em>mutex</em> is a shared semaphore that is initialized to 1. A process P0 will execute <code class=\"language-text\">Wait()</code> operation which will decrement the semaphore to 0 and it will enter the critical section. Now if some other process tries to enter critical section by executing <code class=\"language-text\">Wait()</code> it will not be able to do that because the semaphore is 0 and it will not increment to 1 until the process P0 complete it <code class=\"language-text\">Wait()</code> execution and then executes <code class=\"language-text\">Signal()</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">Signal()</code> will increment mutex to 1 so some process can enter the critical section now.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 85 - Semaphores","date":"March 26, 2021","description":null,"tags":["Operating-Systems"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-84/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 84 -  Peterson's Solution To Critical Section Problem"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-86/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 86 - The Dining-Philosophers Problem"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1bf660cd-9689-587d-9220-e22966cece84","previousPostId":"f1cb9a61-6a4f-574d-adff-05b17fb57b34","nextPostId":"60270e12-6681-50f2-90b6-a448cfee5326"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
