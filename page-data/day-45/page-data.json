For this you have to find and install a new software to complete the work. In Linux you can directly install software from the command line using the Advanced Packaging Tool or apt which comes pre-installed with the Linux.</p>\n<p>Before installing the software you have to check if your OS repository have the required software and to do that we use <code class=\"language-text\">apt-cache</code> command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-cache</span> search package</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Adding Softwares and Pacakges</h2>\n<p>After checking that if the software is in the repo, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">apt-get</code> command followed by install keyword and the name of the software to download and install the software.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> nmap\nReading package lists<span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.

So you must periodically update your local softwares and to do that just type <code class=\"language-text\">update</code> infront of the <code class=\"language-text\">apt-get</code> command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> update\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Updating all necessary Softwares</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># and packages</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The same goes for Upgrading softwares. The newer versions of the sotware are built contain more features and are better at protecting the OS and the system. To upgrade your software, use <code class=\"language-text\">upgrade</code> keyword instead of <code class=\"language-text\">update</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> upgrade\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Upgrades all out-of-date</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># softwares and pacakges</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2>Removing Softwares and Packages</h2>\n<p>The same command is alos used to remove softwares and pacakages from the system. Use <code class=\"language-text\">apt-get</code> followed by <code class=\"language-text\">remove</code> and the name of the package to remove.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> remove nmap</code></pre></div>\n<p>After that it will print some info and ask for permission to remove the software.</p>\n<p>If you want to delete the whole package as well as the configuration files and other settings related files you can use the <code class=\"language-text\">purge</code> keyword instead of the remove.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> purge nmap</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 45 - Instaling, Updating, Removing Software In Linux","date":"February 14, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-44/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 44 - Explaning RegEx Syntax"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"19f32025-c7eb-5792-81d3-5ec1d724f19d","previousPostId":"e9efdae8-43fb-5a5c-bf60-a8c0861e8350","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
