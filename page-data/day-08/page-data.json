First I deployed it to gh-pages branch of the zainsci-blog repo and somehow routing of the blog was not working and then I deleted the gh-pages branch and tried to follow some other method.</p>\n<p>After Serching for some methods of deploying Gatsby Site I came upon Netlify and other Gatsby Cloud. But I didn’t choose anyone of them becuas I have to spend some more time on other serviecs too to keep this running.</p>\n<p>Again I decided to deploy it gh-pages and I was going to deploy to zainsci.github.io repo but here I had to deploy it manually everytime I pushed code to github I had to build and deploy the gatsby-public directory to zainsci.github.io. I tried, published and deleted the repo because I thought of keeping the zainsci.github.io repo for someother porject.</p>\n<p>Then I changed the repo name from “zainsci-blog” to just “blog” and again pushed build code to gh-pages branch to get the domain name zainsci.github.io/blog and here I am after doing this much to again building and deploying this website manually everytime I update It.</p>\n<p>I tried GitHub Actions to make GitHub do the hard work but after some failed attempts with yaml file I deleted it and left it for someother day maybe when I will learn YAML.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>💻 Programming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting ready to learn GraphQL - GastbyJS uses StaticQuery and GraphQL to fetch data from the files and to fully modify it by my own way I have to learn GrpahQL.
