It is called a Uniform Resource Locater or URL for short.</p>\n<h2>What is a URL?</h2>\n<p>URL is a short form for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL, as the name suggests, is an address of a resource on the internet. A resource can be anything, be it an image or text document or HTML document of the website you type the URL of.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">https://www.google.com/search?q=Internet</code></pre></div>\n<p>The above url if typed in the url bar will load HTML page containing search results for Internet.</p>\n<h2>Anatomy of a URL</h2>\n<p>A URL is made of many different parts and I will try to explain most of them in here using the following URL.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">https://www.zainsci.github.io/blog/day-20/?key=value#heading</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Protocol</h3>\n<p>The first part of a URL is the protocol which a browser uses as a method for sharing and transferring data within a computer network.</p>\n<p>In this case the protocal a browser uses for website is <code class=\"language-text\">http:</code> (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) protocol. In modern browsers you don‚Äôt have to type the protocol yourself because the browser adds it in the beginning automatically. Some other protocols that the browser uses are <code class=\"language-text\">file:</code> for opening local files, <code class=\"language-text\">mailto:</code> to open a mailing client. In the above mentioned URL the used protocol is <code class=\"language-text\">https</code> which a better more secure version of <code class=\"language-text\">http</code> where <strong>s</strong> means secure.</p>\n<h3>Domain Name</h3>\n<p>A Domain Name is human readable address to a specific IP (Internet Protocol) Address of a web-server. You type the domain name and the DNS (Domain Name Server) will translate the domain name to it specofied IP Address. The .com, .org, .tech and other like these are called Top Level Domains (TLD).</p>\n<h3>Path to File</h3>\n<p>Next comes the path to the file you want to access on the web-server. The section after the TLD is the up to a Question Mark or A Hash is a path to the file. In this case <code class=\"language-text\">/blog/index.html</code> is the path to index.html file.</p>\n<h3>Parameters</h3>\n<p>Parameters in a URl are key-value pairs followed by <code class=\"language-text\">?</code> separated by <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> symbol. Web Server uses these parameters to do some extra stuff.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code></pre></div>\n<h3><a name=\"heading\"></a> Anchor</h3>\n<p>Anchors are used to navigate to a specific part the page that loads after you type the URL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#heading\">heading</a> &#x3C;‚Äî Click This</p>\n<p>When you clicked the above link the URL in the url-bar changed adding #heading in front of the currnet URL.\nAnother example is on this article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website#Static_website\">Wikipeida</a>. When you open the link it will load the page and will take you to the section that is specified in the URL after the <code class=\"language-text\">#</code> symbol.</p>\n<p>So here you go that is all that I can think of right now about URLs.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>üíª Porgramming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>URL (Uniform Resource Locater) - Some sources to get deep into the Study.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">URL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL\">What is a URL?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internet-tips/understanding-urls/1/\">Understanding URLs</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üóæ Langauge[<span lang=\"ja\">Êó•Êú¨Ë™û</span>]</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>Êà¶Èéö</strong> („Åõ„Çì„Å§„ÅÑ)</span> War Hammer. <span lang=\"ja\">Êà¶</span>: Riot or War, <spna lang=\"ja\">Èéö</span>: Hammer.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>ÂÆâÂøÉ</strong> („ÅÇ„Çì„Åó„Çì)</span> Peace of Mind. <span lan=\"ja\">ÂÆâ</span>: Relax, <span lan=\"ja\">ÂøÉ</span>: Heart.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>Ê°à</strong> („ÅÇ„Çì)</span> Proposal.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>ÊñáÂ≠¶</strong></span> Literature. <span lang=\"ja\">Êñá</span>: Writing, <span lang=\"ja\">Â≠¶</span>: Study.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 20 - Wednesday, January 20, 2021","date":"January 20, 2021","description":null,"tags":["Basics","Web","Internet"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-19/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 19 - Tuesday, January 19, 2021"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-21/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 21 - Thursday, Januray 21, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b85b3522-ad17-5ee1-b4db-14f937dd8606","previousPostId":"830e66cc-28e6-5ef0-981d-48f5de017047","nextPostId":"635b8d51-c9ee-5f1f-9360-0e8ba0052fb4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
