I also know C and all the basics you need to work with C like Memory Allocation etc and sometime ago I started learning and implementing common Data Structures and Algorithms in C but left soon after starting because of another project.</p>\n<p>Now is the time that I restart my Data Structures and Algorithms journey and learn as many as I can. And I will be documenting them here and will write a little intro about them. But first of all what are Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Data Structures</h2>\n<p>A Data Structure is a format for storage, management and organization of data for efficient access and modification. Examples are Hash Tables, Linked Lists and Arrays etc.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm</h2>\n<p>An Algorithm is a step by step process of solving a problem. More specifically an algorithm in Computer Science is a process in which a data is taken as input, processed and a meaningful output is provided as a result. It is a tool for solving problems.</p>\n<h3>Sorting Example</h3>\n<p>As an example, we will see at one of the most fundamental alogrithm for solving one of the most fundamental problem in Computer Science, Sorting random numbers.</p>\n<p>Consider we get a list of numbers of from 0 to 10 and they all are in random order like this.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> numbers <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token number\">5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>we provide the numbers list to a function that implements the sorting algorithm and it will return us list sorted in acsending order.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> sorted_nums <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">sort</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>numbers<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">printf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sorted_nums<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">/*\n * {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n */</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>First of all I will be learning as many Algorithms as I can in these three weeks starting from today and after that I will learn Data Structures for three weeks. Tomorrow I will first discuss about the Big O Notataion and the Efficiency of the Algorithms and the next day after that I will start learning algorithms one by one.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 51 - Data Structures And Algorithms","date":"February 20, 2021","description":null,"tags":["Data-Structures","Algorithms"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-50/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 50 - Resources For Learning Linux"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-52/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 52 - The Big O Notation"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"88081130-9954-5a60-95fc-2759caf7344a","previousPostId":"a4b03b6e-12fb-5bb9-8ec1-8667670d89e6","nextPostId":"9e5dd002-1180-54ee-a295-a66ab8d448fa"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
