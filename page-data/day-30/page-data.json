They are also categorized by their geographical or local scale. The WAN and LAN are two primary and most known types of Computer Netowrks.</p>\n<h2>What is a LAN?</h2>\n<p>LAN or Local Area Network is a type of Computer Network that connects the devices over a short distance. Common examples of LAN are a Home Network or an Office Network. Some buildings can have more than one LANs connected with each other. LAN is controlled by either a signle person or an organization.</p>\n<p>Ethernet and Wi-Fi are two most common types of technologies used to form a LAN. Nowadays wireless connectivity is gaining more popularity because of its easy to connect and use but Ethernet connections are more reliable and secure than wireless connections.</p>\n<h2>What is a WAN?</h2>\n<p>WAN or Wide Area Network is a type of Computer Network that connects the devices or other smaller networks over a wide area or geogrphical distance. Internet is the most widely known example of the WAN. A WAN consists of many LANs connected together. A device called <a href=\"/blog/day-25/\">Router</a> is used to connect a LAN to a WAN. Unline a LAN, WAN (like Internet) is not controlled by a single person or organization rather many organizations manage certain parts of a WAN.</p>\n<p>WAN uses Cables, Telephone Lines and Air Waves technologies for communication channels. WAN operates on Lower Three Layers of the <a href=\"/blog/day-28/\">OSI Model</a>, Network, Data Link and Physical Layer.</p>\n<h2>Other Types of Networks</h2>\n<p>Some other common types of Networks are following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PAN: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network\">Personal Area Network</a></li>\n<li>SAN: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network\">Storage Area Network</a></li>\n<li>CAN: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_area_network\">Campus Area Network</a></li>\n<li>HAN: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_area_network\">Home Area Network</a></li>\n<li>VPN: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">Virtual Private Network</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>and many more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 30 - Saturday, January 30, 2021","date":"January 30, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-29/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 29 - Friday, January 29, 2021"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-31/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 31 - Sunday, Januray 31, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"59314a13-41b7-54c6-b127-c0e4a4b00a9b","previousPostId":"8f0b7e6c-5a4e-5cb1-95db-35820f0e1eae","nextPostId":"f99b5712-8bcb-54a5-8dad-606cf4ef4879"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
