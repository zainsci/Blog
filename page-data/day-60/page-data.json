Three of them were sorting algorithms and two of them were searching algorithm and all of them were mostly basic and easy ones to understand and implement.</p>\n<p>Now I am getting into more difficult and advanced ones. I will try to learn them and also may be try to implement them whenever I got some time but I am getting more busy everyday and also college started so these things are getting a little difficult to learn everyday.</p>\n<p>But I will not stop writing in this blog because the main reason for starting this was to improve my writing and get better in English and use this as a medium to learn more about Computers and Programming.</p>\n<p>I didn’t learned anything new today but I did found out some algorithms from which I will learn. These are following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</li>\n<li>Kruskal’s Algorithm</li>\n<li>Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm</li>\n<li>Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm</li>\n<li>Heap Sort Algorithm</li>\n<li>Hashing Algorithms</li>\n<li>Binary Trees etc</li>\n<li>Powerset Construction</li>\n<li>Monte Carlo Method</li>\n<li>Tree Traversal</li>\n<li>Graph Algorithms</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 60 - Some More Algorithms To Learn","date":"March 01, 2021","description":null,"tags":["Data-Structures","Algorithms"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-59/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 59 - Jump Search Algorithm"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"0f5a96a7-35e4-5e70-a120-ddb9bf33d124","previousPostId":"8e2c7883-317d-5826-ab84-b9bd6d0402c0","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
