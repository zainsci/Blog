First about Linux File System.</p>\n<h2>Linux File System</h2>\n<p>A File System is a system of managing files like images, text files etc and folders (directories) in an operating system. Linux uses UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) for arrarnging directories and files into the filesystem.</p>\n<p>Linux filesystem is different form most of the OS like Windows. It does not uses partition system like C: and D: drives in Windows. At the very top of the filesystem is <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> which is the root directory like a root of a tree but upside down. The <code class=\"language-text\">/</code> or root contains all the important subdirectories like <code class=\"language-text\">/root</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/bin</code> etc. following are some most important subdirectories in Linux filesystem.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>/root</strong> - Home directory of the superuser or Admisintrator</li>\n<li><strong>/bin</strong> - Contains all the binaries or executibles, programs that you can run example: ls, cat, pwd etc</li>\n<li><strong>/dev</strong> - Contains device files</li>\n<li><strong>/home</strong> - User’s home directory</li>\n<li><strong>/lib</strong> - Contains all libraries of code used by programs</li>\n<li><strong>/mnt</strong> - Where other filesystems are attached like USBs or Hard Drives etc</li>\n<li><strong>/tmp</strong> - Contains temporary files</li>\n<li><strong>/boot</strong> - Contains files required for the system to start</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Navigating the Linux FileSystem</h2>\n<p>Unlike Windows or MacOS where Graphical User Interface or GUI is used to navigate the filesystem, Linux uses shell also known as command-line or terminal to navigate the filesystem. In terminal, commands are used to perform actions like finding current directory or moving or deleting files etc.</p>\n<p>When you open a terminal or shell or command-line, you will find somthing already written in the terminal like following.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is called a prompt. You write the commands in front of the dollar sign and hit enter and it will perform the action of the command. The <code class=\"language-text\">~</code> or Tilde sign means you are in the home directory.</p>\n<p>After opening a terminal you have to know in what directory you are in and to find that <code class=\"language-text\">pwd</code> command is used.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:~$ <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">pwd</span>\n/root</code></pre></div>\n<p>you are in the /root directory if you logged in as the superuser.</p>\n<p>I have already written about command-line and some basic commands to know to work with Linux, So I will not write them again and if you want to, you can read it <a href=\"/blog/day-19/\">Here</a>.</p>\n<p>Some commands that are not discussed in the above mentioned post that are also necessary to know are following.</p>\n<h3>Creating a file</h3>\n<p>Command: touch</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> tmp\nroot@User:/tmp$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> new_file.txt\nroot@User:/tmp$ <span class=\"token function\">ls</span>\nnew_file.txt</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Looking for help</h3>\n<p>Command: man</p>\n<p>Typing man with the command as the argument will show the Manual Pages for the command.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">root@User:/$ <span class=\"token function\">man</span> <span class=\"token function\">clear</span>\n\nclear<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>        General Commands Manual     clear<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nNAME\n    <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> - <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> the terminal <span class=\"token function\">screen</span>\n\nSYNOPSIS\n   <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>-Ttype<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>-V<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>-x<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> clears your <span class=\"token function\">screen</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> this is possible, including\n    its scrollback buffer <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>if the extended “E3” capability\n    is defined<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>.  <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> looks <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> the environment <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> the\n    terminal <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">type</span> given by the environment variable <span class=\"token environment constant\">TERM</span>,\n    and <span class=\"token keyword\">then</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> the terminfo database to determine how to\n    <span class=\"token function\">clear</span> the screen.\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.</code></pre></div>\n<p>and Many more I will discuss in the next post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 33 - Linux Basics And File System","date":"February 02, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-32/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 32 - What is Linux?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-34/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 34 - Navigating Linux Command Line"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a62aeb85-f89a-5cc8-8827-f6a54cc1dfbb","previousPostId":"f8f902cf-2577-5c50-bcdd-4aa9250abbd7","nextPostId":"f9d48f62-5511-5e4a-b996-ea57ba1dc6cb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
