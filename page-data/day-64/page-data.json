The priority is defined with an integer like between 1 and 10 and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority in the queue. In some systems 1 can mean the higest priority or it can mean the lowest priority depending on how it is implemented.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token operator\">|</span> Name <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> Time <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> Priority <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>        <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P2</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>        <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P3</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>        <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// By this P2 will be processed first instead of P1</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// and after that P3 and P1 will be the last one</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// to be processed</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Round Robin Scheduling</h3>\n<p>Another way to schedule the jobs is to assign a small amount of time to each process to execute it and after that time is up stop that and process and get to the next one. This way all the porcesses are getting equal amount of time and the processes which are shorter in run time will execute first and the processes that are longer in run time will take more time to complete. This small time is called <strong>Time Quantum</strong> or <strong>Time Slice</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token operator\">|</span> Name <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> Time <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">24</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P2</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P3</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> timeSlice <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// These tasks will run in following time until all</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// the tasks are completed</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P2</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P3</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token constant\">P1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">0</span>    <span class=\"token number\">4</span>    <span class=\"token number\">7</span>    <span class=\"token number\">10</span>   <span class=\"token number\">14</span>   <span class=\"token number\">18</span>   <span class=\"token number\">22</span>   <span class=\"token number\">26</span>   <span class=\"token number\">30</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I think these are enough for now as I will be leaving this Data-Strcutures and Algorithms Series for the moment and will focus on learning about the OS from tomorrown because that is what I will be learning at college.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day 64 - Scheduling and Scheduling Algorithms [1]","date":"March 05, 2021","description":null,"tags":["Data-Structures","Algorithms"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-63/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 63 - Scheduling and Scheduling Algorithms [0]"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/day-65/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Day 65 - Operating Systems | Overview"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3130ab3d-924a-5b1d-9e2e-a7e1a0bf21ea","previousPostId":"663426c8-f948-5471-abe6-24b2ef5a6a43","nextPostId":"5b9ceb1e-2474-55e6-8508-db35d056ef55"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1578995489","290055352","3347749741","3894407297"]}
