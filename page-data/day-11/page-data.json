From the very first day I understood everthing about the basics of React and started building with it small projects to get familliar with it.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because of my past experience with learning Vue.js as both have some simillar concepts like Components etc. But comparing both Vue.js and React I definately like React the most and in my opinion react is much simpler and easier to learn than Vue.js and other JS frameworks. I haven’t learned Angular yet but since it requires Typescript, it is much difficult to learn than React.</p>\n<p>I didn’t learn anything new today becasue didn’t got anytime but I read some articles on some technologies that I already know or currently learning like React and Gatsbyjs and GrapghQL.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned Today</h2>\n<h3>💻 Programming</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual Guide on GraphQL - I read this article on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/graphql-concepts/\">Concepts of GraphQL</a> since I am working with Gatsby and GraphQL is a big part of how it handles data and also I want to increase the use of GraphQL in this blog for adding some more data to HTML and increase SEO rating etc.</li>\n<li>I also read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-write-better-functional-components-in-react-bc974f777145\">Medium article</a> on Tips to write better functional components in React and the thing I learned in this is the use of useMemo Hook to memoize or cache data to better the performace of the component and aviod useless re-renders. Here’s the official documentation on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo\">React useMemo Hook</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🗾 Langauge[<span lang=\"ja\">日本語</span>]</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>楽器</strong> (がっき)</span> Musical Instrument. <span lang=\"ja\">楽</span>: Music, <span lang=\"ja\">器</span>: Tool or Instrument.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>鶏肉</strong> (とりにく)</span> Chicken.<span lang=\"ja\">鶏</span>: Bird, <span lang=\"ja\">肉</span>: Meat.</li>\n<li><span lang=\"ja\"><strong>切る</strong> (きる)</span> Cut.
