It generates a report about your websites performance and SEO etc and tells you what should you do if your website has some flaws that is causing some low performance and such. Following are some things that I learned for today to improve the quailty of my website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Properly Size Images - First being the images that are rendered on the website are smaller than those are being loaded. This <a href=\"https://web.dev/uses-responsive-images/?utm_source=lighthouse&#x26;utm_medium=devtools\">Article</a> explains that you should serve images in the same size in which they are rendered on the website. This issue can also be solved by serving Responsive Images which is that you should serve images according to the device on which the website is being loaded and is explained in this <a href=\"https://web.dev/serve-responsive-images/\">Article</a>.</li>\n<li>Serve images in Next-Gen formats - This means Image formats like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP are better choices for serving images on the web as they provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. I have only one image on this website which was in a PNG format and then I resized it and converted in WEBP to solve these two probelms.
